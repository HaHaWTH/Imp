## Downloads

**Imp is still in experimental stage. Don't use it in production environment.**

In normal case, you can download the latest JAR file from releases tab [here](https://github.com/HaHaWTH/Polpot/releases)

**Please note:** Java >= 8 is required.

## How does this work?

Imp is a Minecraft server reimplementation running on Spigot like a plugin.

We are using Spigot to load Imp, which implements the server side logic of the game.
